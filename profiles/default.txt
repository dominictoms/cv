Full stack developer with a keen interest in all things computers. Experienced in many high level programming languages, web development, cloud computing and games development. Recently graduated from the University of East Anglia with a bachelors in computing science. When Iâ€™m not programming, I enjoy performing DJ mixes at local clubs, longboarding around the countryside and cooking vegetarian food.
